    "text": "General Information\nWhat: This workshop will introduce key concepts in geographical analysis and visualization, with a focus on identifying and dealing with spatial structure in geographic data. We will touch on spatial regression and prediction with kriging.\nWho: The course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, staff, faculty, and other researchers across campus who are interested in learning how to use R for geographic analysis and visualization. Basic statistical knowledge and some familiarity with R are encouraged but not required to attend this workshop.\nRequirements: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can download R and Rstudio (and you should do so before the workshop).\nContact: Please email andrew.george@hsc.utah.edu or brenna.kelly@hsc.utah.edu for more information."
